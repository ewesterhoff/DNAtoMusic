# DNAtoMusic
Transforms a text file of atcg type into unique midi file

## Goals of Project
This project will create a midi file from an existing text file of DNA.  In addition, the program will be able to read midi files and convert them into text files of DNA.

The overall goal of the project is to import the midi file into Sibelius, where it will be edited for a live or recorded performance.  The edited version, in midi form, will still be readable by the program.

##So, where's the biology?
The biology of this project comes from the text file that is being imported.  (To be determined at a later date) In addition, a metaphor for the random mutations that occur would be the mistakes that the live performer makes.
